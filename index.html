                <p>“While many aspects of this technology are uncertain, it seems clear that it will move into the managerial scene rapidly, with definite and far-reaching impact on managerial organization,” they wrote. Six decades later, it’s clear that
                    Leavitt and Whisler were onto something big. Today, information technology refers to everything that businesses use computers for. Information technology is building communications networks for a company, safeguarding data and information,
                    creating and administering databases, helping employees troubleshoot problems with their computers or mobile devices, or doing a range of other work to ensure the efficiency and security of business information systems.</p>

            <div class="second-service">
                <p>Computer technology is leading to more accurate sizing and rating methods for process equipment. Heat exchangers are designed with high-precision prediction methods and complex numerical techniques to account for the local flow and temperature
                    conditions. Fouling mitigation is just changing from an art to a science-based technology. The real benefits of sophisticated design codes will not be achieved without reliable fouling prediction methods and mitigation techniques that
                    can be incorporated into the design phase. Recent developments in the computer technology provide an opportunity to productively use fouling information that is scattered in the literature, industry log books, and in reports. A long-term
                    goal for the industry is to develop a knowledge-based system for designing and operating heat exchangers with a minimum impact of water fouling.</p>

                <p>Teacher education or teacher training refers to the policies, procedures, and provision designed to equip (prospective) teachers with the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and skills they require to perform their tasks effectively in the
                    classroom, school, and wider community. The professionals who engage in training the prospective teachers are called teacher educators (or, in some contexts, teacher trainers). There is a longstanding and ongoing debate about the most
                    appropriate term to describe these activities. The term 'teacher training' (which may give the impression that the activity involves training staff to undertake relatively routine tasks) seems to be losing ground, at least in the U.S.,
                    to 'teacher education' (with its connotation of preparing staff for a professional role as a reflective practitioner).The two major components of teacher education are in-service teacher education and pre-service teacher education.</p>
